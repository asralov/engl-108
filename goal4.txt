Learning outcome: 4D. identify the collaborative and social aspects of writing processes.
One of the most useful and turning points in the writing process - is to have a collaborative environment where you can talk to your peers and discuss common problems that can be solved further. While doing peers reviews and collaborative discussions, I was able to reflect on my mistakes I made while working on major projects in this class. Helped me to avoid them in the future and thoroughly process the data after discussing it with my professors and peers.
