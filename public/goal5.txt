Learning outcome: 5C. assess how writing experiences and artifacts might influence future writing situations.
I truly believe that as I gain more and more knowledge and experience on how to write appropriately, I will be able to use all the hard-work skills I have gained in English courses in my future classes where I am expected to write an academic research paper or literary review, or even a fairy tail story. Since i am able to work on any writing assignments so far, and it has been a while since i constantly started writing, i am assuming i will not have hard times in writing those papers for my future classes. And it is worth mentioning that it is not only about writing and getting to know with writing every day. But there is another aspect of the learning process that is called collecting artifacts and reflecting on them for future improvements. If I were to save my assignments and other writings on my laptop or elsewhere, I would be able to open that in my free time and read, reflect. Past writings could help me to revise my mistakes from the previous writing experiences and evolve in my writing style. Hence, it is important to save your work for the future and constantly reflect on your job you have done so far.
