Learning outcome: 2D. evaluate the quality, appropriateness, and credibility of sources.
One of the most vital lessons in this class was to check the credibility of the source we want to approach in our papers. We have been exposed to several writing tools and web sources to make our paper credible and trustworthy. There are some websites such as “Google Scholar” and “University of Arizona’s Main Library Website”. We were able to find well-known, verified and credible sources, academic and scientific papers. I was able to use it for the last major second project where we worked on literary review.
