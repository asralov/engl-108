Learning outcome: 1A. identify the purposes of, intended audiences for, and arguments in a text, as situated within particular cultural, economic, and political contexts.
Through my journey in engl108 class, I have been able to recognize the context of the assigned readings and other students’ writings. While reading the provided content in the class, I could classify each text’s purpose, intended audience, as well as economical and political ideologies. I have come across that there is an intended audience for each writing. As an example we can take the academic research paper about some science innovation. The primary audience is meant to be people with interest and patience in science, as well students who study in an academic setting.
